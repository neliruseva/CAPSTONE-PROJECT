# Phase 2

## State/UT wise analysis.

Note :
You need to be careful as this phase is whole state/ut wise analysis (not district-wise).

It is up to you which columns you want to keep or delete to make proper analysis"


2.1	Analysis of Literacy Rate vs Total Crimes.

2.2	 Analysis of the type of crime vs each state vs Literacy rate.

2.3	Analysis of year-on-year total crime rate.

2.4	 Analysis of area vs overall crime

2.5	 Analysis of Population vs overall Crime

2.6	Each state crime report. There is no fixed format to write a report, you can write a report inside the notebook itself based on what you have analyzed in the above points.
