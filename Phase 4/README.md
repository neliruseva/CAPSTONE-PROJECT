# Phase 4 

Clustering and Overall Story

## Unsupervised ML (Clustering)


Note: This phase requires your general knowledge and thought process to merge the right datasets and the right columns. Collecting quality data is a key factor to create meaningful clusters and Analysis.

Assumption: You were given various crime datasets that contains all the DISTRICTS in each state and you were asked to provide the below data to the higher authorities for further action.


4.1  "Create 3 clusters as below.

   1. Sensitive Area's

   2. Moderate Area's

   3. Peaceful Area's"

4.2  Create DataFrame for each cluster that shows data according to the areas.

4.3  "Analyse your clusters and prepare a report that explains all your observations.

   Example - 

    1. What is impacting more crimes in sensitive areas. 

    2. What needs to be done to reduce crime. 

    3. Most safe and unsafe districts.

    4. Etc.......Anything that you observe (If you want, you can plot various graphs to analyze)"

4.4   Capstone project overall story in your own words. Min 1000 words.
